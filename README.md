- 👋 Hi, I’m @BriarmossX1

- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and make funtional products. 
I'd love to make this a career. I started learning MSDos when I 5yr old.
...

- 🌱 I’m currently learning(or always still working on learning) Javascript and C#.
...

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on I really don't know yet. I need to work on a project to get the experience,
but I don't get to much time to really work on anything with work, kids, and life. 
As most can see I don't get to push to my gethub pretty much at all.
...
